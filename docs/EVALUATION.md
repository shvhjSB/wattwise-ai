# WattWise AI — Evaluation

How WattWise models are evaluated. This page describes the method. **No model has been trained
yet, so no metrics are reported.** The evaluation harness (T011) and the baselines (T012) will add
results here, each with the exact command that produced it.

## Splits (T010)

Code: [`wattwise.ml.splits`](../backend/src/wattwise/ml/splits.py). Design decision: D018.

### Rules

1. **Time windows, never shuffled rows.** Every split is a set of UTC time windows, so a model is
   always tested on a period after the data it learned from.
2. **Windows are half-open: `start <= t < end`.**
   - A reading's timestamp marks the start of its interval (DATA_CONTRACT.md).
   - A reading belongs to a window only if its **whole interval** lies inside it:
     `[timestamp, timestamp + interval)`. The interval is the meter's most common step, the same
     rule the quality engine uses.
   - A daily reading that starts before a boundary and ends after it is therefore not used.
3. **An optional gap** is left out before the validation and test windows. Use it when features
   or labels look across the boundary, for example a forecast horizon.
4. **A building holdout** keeps chosen buildings, or whole sites, out of training and validation
   completely. They are tested only in the test window, as `test_unseen`.
5. **Every split checks itself.**
   - `make_split` re-checks every fold on the actual rows. A violation raises `LeakageError`;
     tests show these checks catch tampered folds.
   - The checks: no reading has two roles, every row lies in its window, earlier roles end
     before later roles start, and no held-out building is in training, validation or `test`.
   - A role with no readings is an error, which catches windows outside the data.
6. **Deterministic.**
   - The same config and data always give the same split, whatever the row order.
   - The manifest records the config and its SHA-256. `read_config` re-creates the config from a
     saved manifest and rejects a manifest whose config was edited.

### Chronological split

```
train_start            validation_start        test_start              test_end
|-------- train -------|gap|--- validation ---|gap|-------- test --------|
```

Validation is optional. Without `validation_start`, training runs up to `test_start - gap`.

### Rolling origin (expanding window)

```
fold-1  |========== train ==========|gap|-test-|
fold-2  |============== train ==============|gap|-test-|
fold-3  |================== train ==================|gap|-test-|
         train_start                  first_test_start + k * step
```

Fold *k* (from 0) is laid out as follows:
- **Test window:** `[first_test_start + k × step, … + horizon)`.
- **Training window:** `[train_start, its test start − gap)`.

A `step` shorter than the `horizon` makes test windows overlap from fold to fold; within a fold,
training still ends first. Durations are fixed lengths, not calendar months. Multiples of 7 days
give every window the same mix of weekdays.

### Holdout and roles

`Holdout(fraction, seed, group_by)` picks `round(fraction × groups)` buildings or sites, at least
one and never all. The draw uses `numpy.random.default_rng(seed)` over the sorted IDs of the
buildings present in the readings.

| Role | Buildings | Window |
|---|---|---|
| `train` | not held out | train |
| `validation` | not held out | validation |
| `test` | not held out | test: future period, seen buildings |
| `test_unseen` | held out | test: future period, unseen buildings |

- **Unseen buildings are tested only in the future window.** Testing them over the whole period
  would share time, weather and events with training, which is optimistic.
- **A site holdout (`group_by="site"`) is stricter than a building holdout.** Buildings on one
  site share a weather station and often schedules. Results for unseen buildings at seen sites
  must say so.

### Unused readings

Every reading without a role is counted, per fold, under one reason:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `held_out_before_test` | A held-out building's readings in the train or validation window |
| `gap` | The reading lies in a gap between two windows |
| `straddles_boundary` | The reading's interval crosses a window boundary |
| `outside_windows` | Before the first window or after the last |
| `unknown_interval` | The meter has a single timestamp, so its interval is unknown |

### Manifest

`write_manifest(split, path)` writes deterministic JSON. The evaluation harness (T011) saves it
with every result. It contains:

- `split_version`, `config_sha256` and `config`: the full config, with UTC timestamps and ISO
  8601 durations.
- `holdout_building_ids`.
- Per fold:
  - the windows
  - per role: rows, non-missing values, meters, buildings, and the first and last timestamps
  - the counts of unused readings by reason

### Example

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime
from wattwise.ml.splits import (
    Chronological, Holdout, Role, SplitConfig, make_split, write_manifest,
)

config = SplitConfig(
    time=Chronological(
        train_start=datetime(2016, 1, 1, tzinfo=UTC),
        validation_start=datetime(2017, 7, 1, tzinfo=UTC),
        test_start=datetime(2017, 10, 1, tzinfo=UTC),
        test_end=datetime(2018, 1, 2, tzinfo=UTC),
    ),
    holdout=Holdout(fraction=0.2, seed=2016, group_by="site"),
)
split = make_split(readings, config, buildings)  # canonical tables
train = split.folds[0].rows(Role.TRAIN)
write_manifest(split, path)
```

**Observed on the BDG2 sample** (2026-10-24; 20 meters from 9 sites; the T009b default sample).
This shows split sizes only. It is not a model result.

| Role | Rows | Non-missing | Meters | First | Last |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `train` | 196,825 | 183,325 | 15 | 2016-01-01T00:00Z | 2017-06-30T23:00Z |
| `validation` | 33,120 | 30,743 | 15 | 2017-07-01T00:00Z | 2017-09-30T23:00Z |
| `test` | 33,159 | 28,982 | 15 | 2017-10-01T00:00Z | 2018-01-01T05:00Z |
| `test_unseen` | 11,055 | 11,028 | 5 | 2017-10-01T00:00Z | 2018-01-01T04:00Z |

- The site holdout drew Cockatoo and Peacock: 5 meters. Their 76,645 earlier readings are
  unused.
- The test window ends on 2018-01-02 because the BDG2 local year ends up to 8 hours later in UTC.

### What splits do not protect against

- **Feature leakage.** Lags, rolling statistics, imputation and scaling must be computed or
  fitted from training data only. T013 adds leakage tests for features.
- **Repeated looking at the test set.** Choose models and settings on validation or rolling
  folds. Use the test window once per reported result.
- **Shared context.** Unseen buildings at a seen site share weather and schedules with training
  buildings; use a site holdout for strict claims.
